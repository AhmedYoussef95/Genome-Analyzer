Dengue virus,NC_001477,"The cause of the infamous dengue fever, Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne single-stranded virus most common to tropical and sub-tropical climates across the globe. It is one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide."
Zika virus,NC_012532.1,"Flaviviridae Flavivirus, or the Zika virus, is native to Uganda's Ziika forests and spreads through mosquitoes. It received global attention as a consequence of the 2015 Zika virus epidemic. It has a single-stranded RNA genome."
Human mitochondrial genome,NC_012920,"Unlike the majority of the human genome, the human mitochondrial genome is located within the cell's mitochondria. Another unique trait is that it is inherited exclusively from the mother. It codes for 37 genes out of a total of ~20,000 human genes."
Human chromosome Y,NC_000024,"The Y chromosome is the sex-determing chromosome in humans as well as other species, and is inherited exclusively from the father. Its more than 50 genes are primarily responsible for male-specific traits, such as the development of testis."
Mycobacterium tuberculosis,AP018033,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogenic bacterial species that causes tuberculosis. Its full genome was published in 1998, making it one of the first species to have its genome sequenced."
Mycobacterium leprae,AL450380,Mycobacterium leprae is a rod-shaped pathogenic bacteria that causes leprosy. It is also known as 'Hansen's bacillus spirilly'.
Escherichia coli,U00096,"Escherichia coli, or simply E. coli, is a rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of humans and other warm-blooded organisms. Its rapid cell cycle and low maintenance have turned it into the predominant prokaryotic model organism for genetic studies."
Salmonella enterica,CP022663,"This rod-shaped bacteria has seven subspecies and over 2,500 serovars. They can infect cattle and poultry, making it the leading cause of food poisoning in the United States."
Sesamum indicum,NC_026145,"Sesamum indicum, commonly known as the sesame plant, is a flowering plant with edible seeds native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a common ingredient in cuisines worldwide."
Drosophila chromosome 4,NC_004353.4,"Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is arguably the scientific community's favorite model organism. Close to two-thirds of it genes are identical in humans, which accounts for its usage in researching several human diseases. Chromosome 4 is the smallest of its four chromosomes and contains between 50 and 75 genes."
C. elegans chromosome 1,BX284601,"Commonly known as the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans is a microscopic nematode that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the first multicellular organism to have both its whole genome and connectome sequenced."
